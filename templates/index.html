                is not the case anymore as observed. Most people don't wear the face mask correctly.
                This is why this face mask detection platform is built, its goal is to predict wheter someone is earing a
                face mask correctly, incorrectly or not.
                The performmance of this system relies on a model built using deep learning. A proper way of wearing a face

                Using Face Mask Detection System, Hospitals can monitor if their staff is wearing masks during their
                    shift or not. If any health worker is found without a mask, they will receive a notification with a
                    reminder to wear a mask. Also, if quarantine people who are required to wear a mask, the system can keep
                    an eye and detect if the mask is present or not and send notification automatically or report to the
                    authorities.

            <h2>Airports</h2>
            <p> <b>
                The Face Mask Detection System can be used at airports to detect travelers without masks. Face data of
                    travelers can be captured in the system at the entrance. If a traveler is found to be without a face
                    mask, their picture is sent to the airport authorities so that they could take quick action. If the
                    person’s face is already stored, like the face of an Airport worker, it can send the alert to the
                    worker’s phone directly.

                The Face Mask Detection System can be used at office premises to detect if employees are maintaining
                   safety standards at work. It monitors employees without masks and sends them a reminder to wear a mask.
                   The reports can be downloaded or sent an email at the end of the day to capture people who are not
                   complying with the regulations or the requirements.
